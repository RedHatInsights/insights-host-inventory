# Insights Inventory

This project is the home of the host-based inventory for the Insights Platform.

## Getting Started

This project uses pipenv to manage the development and deployment environments.
To set the project up for development do the following:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

Afterwards you can activate the virtual environment by running:

```
pipenv shell
```

Included is a docker-compose file `dev.yml` that will start a postgres database that is
useful for development.

```
docker-compose -f dev.yml up
```

By default the database container will use a bit of local storage so that data
you enter will be persisted across multiple starts of the container.  If you
want to destroy that data do the following:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Running the Tests

Running the tests is quite simple:

```
./test_api.py
./test_unit.py
```

## Running the server

Prometheus was designed to run in a multi-threaded
environment whereas gunicorn uses a multi-process
architecture.  As a result, there is some work
to be done to make prometheus integrate with
gunicorn.

A temp directory for prometheus needs to be created
before the server starts.  The prometheus_multiproc_dir
environment needs to point to this directory.  The
contents of this directory need to be removed between
runs.

A command to run the server in a cluster.

```
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py run
```

Running the server locally for development. In this case it’s not necessary to
care about the Prometheus temp directory or to set the
_prometheus_multiproc_dir_ environment variable. This is done automatically.

```
python run_gunicorn.py 
```

Configuration system properties:

```
 prometheus_multiproc_dir=/path/to/prometheus_dir
 APP_NAME="inventory"
 PATH_PREFIX="/r/insights/platform"
 INVENTORY_DB_USER="insights"
 INVENTORY_DB_PASS="insights"

 INVENTORY_DB_NAME="test_db"
 INVENTORY_DB_POOL_TIMEOUT="5"
 INVENTORY_DB_POOL_SIZE="5"
 INVENTORY_LOGGING_CONFIG_FILE=logconf.ini
```

## Deployment

The application provides some management information about itself. These
endpoints are exposed at the root path _/_ and thus are accessible only
from inside of the deployment cluster.

* _/health_ responds with _200_ to any GET requests, point your liveness
  or readiness probe here.
* _/metrics_ offers metrics and monitoring intended to be pulled by
  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). 

## API Documentation

The API is described by an OpenAPI specification file
[_swagger/api/api.spec.yaml_](swagger/api.spec.yaml). The application exposes
a browsable Swagger UI Console at
[_/r/insights/platform/inventory/api/v1/ui/_](http://localhost:8080/r/insights/platform/inventory/api/v1/ui/).

## Operation

The Insights Inventory service is responsible for storing information
about hosts and deduplicating hosts as they are reported.  The
Inventory service uses the canonical facts to perform the deduplication.
The canonical facts are:
* insights_id
* rhel_machine_id
* subscription_manager_id
* satellite_id
* bios_uuid
* ip_addresses
* fqdn
* mac_addresses

Hosts are added and updated by sending a POST to the /hosts endpoint.
(See the API Documentation for more details on the POST method).
This method returns an *id* which should be used to reference the host
by other services in the Insights platform.

Overview of the deduplication process:

```
  If the update request includes an insights_id, then the inventory service
  will lookup the host using the insights_id.  If the inventory service
  finds a host with a matching insights_id, then the host will be updated
  and the canonical facts from the update request will replace the existing
  canonical facts.

  If the update request does not include an insights_id, then the canonical facts
  will be used to lookup the host.  If the canonical facts from the update
  request are a subset or a superset of the previously stored canonical facts,
  then the host will be updated and any new canonical facts from the request
  will be added to the existing host entry.

  If the canonical facts based lookup does not locate an existing host, then
  a new host entry is created.
```
