# Insights Inventory

This project is the home of the host-based inventory for the Insights Platform.

## Getting Started

This project uses pipenv to manage the development and deployment environments.
To set the project up for development do the following:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

Afterwards you can activate the virtual environment by running:

```
pipenv shell
```

Included is a docker-compose file `dev.yml` that will start a postgres database that is
useful for development.

```
docker-compose -f dev.yml up
```

By default the database container will use a bit of local storage so that data
you enter will be persisted across multiple starts of the container.  If you
want to destroy that data do the following:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Running the Tests

Running the tests is quite simple:

```
./test_api.py
./test_unit.py
```

## Running the server

Prometheus was designed to run in a multi-threaded
environment whereas gunicorn uses a multi-process
architecture.  As a result, there is some work
to be done to make prometheus integrate with
gunicorn.

A temp directory for prometheus needs to be created
before the server starts.  The prometheus_multiproc_dir
environment needs to point to this directory.  The
contents of this directory need to be removed between
runs.

A command to run the server in a cluster.

```
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py run
```

Running the server locally for development. In this case itâ€™s not necessary to
care about the Prometheus temp directory or to set the
_prometheus_multiproc_dir_ environment variable. This is done automatically.

```
python run_gunicorn.py 
```

Configuration system properties:

```
 prometheus_multiproc_dir=/path/to/prometheus_dir
 APP_NAME="inventory"
 PATH_PREFIX="/r/insights/platform"
 INVENTORY_DB_USER="insights"
 INVENTORY_DB_PASS="insights"
 INVENTORY_DB_HOST="localhost"
 INVENTORY_DB_NAME="test_db"
 INVENTORY_DB_POOL_TIMEOUT="5"
 INVENTORY_DB_POOL_SIZE="5"
```

## Deployment

The application provides some management information about itself. These
endpoints are exposed at the root path _/_ and thus are accessible only
from inside of the deployment cluster.

* _/health_ responds with _200_ to any GET requests, point your liveness
  or readiness probe here.
* _/metrics_ offers metrics and monitoring intended to be pulled by
  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).
